# Simple JPEG Decoder
This a simple JPEG decoder written in C++ and it can be successfully compiled in Microsoft Visual Studio 2017.

### P.S.
The whole project is based on [a JPEG decoder with Chinese comments](https://blog.csdn.net/wthor/article/details/78230871?utm_medium=distribute.pc_relevant.none-task-blog-BlogCommendFromMachineLearnPai2-20.nonecase&depth_1-utm_source=distribute.pc_relevant.none-task-blog-BlogCommendFromMachineLearnPai2-20.nonecase). Compared with the original project, I add some more detailed comments in Chinese, fix some bugs, optimize the logic and rearrange the structure to make it easier to read.
